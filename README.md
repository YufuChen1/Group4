# Grades
PS1: 80 points. your grade is 8 out of 10. Excellent job! 

PS2:

PS3: 6/10. Good job! check my solutions to see the parts to improve.

PS4: 7.25/10. Great! check my solutions especially for exercise 3. Also in 2c, do not forget to plot at t=0 (that is before tfp shock). With that we can see the immediate effect of the shock---a sudden increase in ooutput.
