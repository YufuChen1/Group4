# Grades
PS1: 80 points. your grade is 8 out of 10. Excellent job! 

PS2: 6/10, good job!

PS3: 6/10. Good job! check my solutions to see the parts to improve.

PS4: 7.25/10. Great! check my solutions especially for exercise 3. Also in 2c, do not forget to plot at t=0 (that is before tfp shock). With that we can see the immediate effect of the shock---a sudden increase in ooutput.

PS5: 5/10.  Note: for all of this, it is very difficult to assign partial credit when you have no discussion (in words) of your results. When you're completing the exam, you will need to make a more substantial effort to describe, in plain words, not code, what you're doing and why you're doing it.

PS6: 6.5/10.  Need more discussion, even when you're not getting correct solutions

PS7: 6.5/10.  Good attempt, but many parts not working. See my solutions
